    "1. # What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) (OOP)?\n",
    "   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects are like real-world entities; they have data (variables) (data) and behaviors (functions inside class).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. # What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "   - A class is like a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. # What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "   - An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. # What is the difference between abstraction (showing only important details, hiding extra) and encapsulation (hiding data and methods together)?\n",
    "   - Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only essential features. Its main purpose is to reduce complexity.Encapsulation means bundling data and functions inside class together inside a class and controlling access to them. Its main purpose is data protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. # What are dunder functions inside class in Python?\n",
    "   - Dunder (double underscore) functions inside class, also called magic or special functions inside class, are functions inside class whose names begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. # Explain the concept of inheritance (child class getting features from parent class) in OOP.\n",
    "   - Inheritance allows a class (child) to reuse properties and behaviors of another class (parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. # What is polymorphism (same function working in different ways) in OOP?\n",
    "   - Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond differently to the same method or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. # How is encapsulation (hiding data and methods together) achieved in Python?\n",
    "   - Encapsulation is achieved by wrapping data and functions inside class inside a class and controlling access using access modifiers (public, _protected, __private).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. # What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "   - A constructor is a special method __init__ that runs automatically when an object is created. It initializes the object's data (variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. # What are class and static functions inside class in Python?\n",
    "    - Class Method: Declared using @classmethod. The first parameter is cls. It can access or modify class-level variables.Static Method: Declared using @staticmethod. It has no self or cls parameter. It is used for utility/helper functions that don’t depend on class or instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. # What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "    - Python does not support true method overloading (like Java or C++). Instead, it can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. # What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "    - Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. # What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "    - The @property decorator makes a method act like an attribute. It is commonly used with getter, setter, and deleter functions inside class for controlled access to private data (variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "14. # Why is polymorphism (same function working in different ways) important in OOP?\n",
    "    - Polymorphism increases flexibility, reusability, and simplicity by allowing the same interface/method to work with different object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. # What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "    - An abstract class is a class that cannot be create an objectd directly. It is meant to be inherited and usually contains abstract functions inside class (defined but not implemented).\n",
    "\n",
    "16. # What are the benefits of OOP?\n",
    "    - OOP provides modular code, reusability through inheritance (child class getting features from parent class), data security with encapsulation (hiding data and methods together), abstraction (showing only important details, hiding extra) to hide complexity, and polymorphism (same function working in different ways) for flexible code. It makes programs easier to maintain, scale, and model real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. # What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "    - Class Variable: Shared by all instances of a class. Defined inside the class but outside any method. Instance Variable: Unique to each object. Defined inside the constructor (__init__).\n",
    "\n",
    "18. # What is multiple inheritance (child class getting features from parent class) in Python?\n",
    "    - Multiple inheritance (child class getting features from parent class) means a class can inherit from more than one parent class, giving it access to data (variables) and functions inside class from all parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. # Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ functions inside class in Python.\n",
    "    - __str__: Returns a user-friendly string of an object (for display).__repr__: Returns an unambiguous, developer-friendly string (for debugging/recreation).\n",
    "\n",
    "20. # What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
    "    - The super() function is used to call functions inside class from a parent class in a child class. It avoids duplication and ensures correct method resolution in multiple inheritance (child class getting features from parent class).\n",
    "\n",
    "21. # What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "    - The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. # What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "    - @staticmethod: Defines a method that does not access class or instance data. Works like a regular function inside a class. @classmethod: Takes cls as the first argument and can access/modify class-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. # How does polymorphism (same function working in different ways) work in Python with inheritance (child class getting features from parent class)?\n",
    "    - Polymorphism in inheritance (child class getting features from parent class) allows a child class to override parent functions inside class. The same method name shows different behavior depending on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. # What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "    - Method chaining means calling multiple functions inside class on the same object in a single line, where each method returns the object (self). This makes code concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. # What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "    - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. It makes objects behave like functions, adding flexibility."
